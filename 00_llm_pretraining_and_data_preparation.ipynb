              "   'value': '<|begin_of_thought|>\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but let\\'s break it down step by step.\\n\\nSo, Joisino wants to open a shop, and she has to decide which periods (there are 10 in total, 5 days each with morning and evening) to open. Her shop must be open at least once. For each existing shop, we calculate the number of overlapping open periods (c_i) between her shop and theirs. The profit is the sum of P_i,c_i for all shops. We need to find the maximum possible profit by choosing the best possible schedule for her shop.\\n\\nConstraints: N can be up to 100. For each of the 10 periods, her shop can be open or closed, but at least one must be open. The P_i,c_i values can be negative, so even if overlapping a lot, it might be better to not overlap to avoid penalties.\\n\\nFirst, the key points are:\\n\\n1. We need to iterate over all possible combinations of open/closed for the 10 periods (excluding the case where all are closed).\\n2. For each possible combination, calculate the sum of P_i,c_i for each shop i, where c_i is the count of overlapping periods between her schedule and shop i\\'s.\\n3. Find the maximum sum possible.\\n\\nBut wait, the number of possible combinations is 2^10 - 1 = 1023 possibilities. That\\'s manageable because 1023 is a small number even for N=100. So the approach here is brute-force: check all possible valid schedules (non-zero) and compute the profit for each, then select the maximum.\\n\\nSo the plan is:\\n\\n- Precompute for each shop i the list of their open periods (so for each i, a bitmask or a set indicating which periods they are open).\\n- For each possible Joisino\\'s schedule (from 1 to 2^10-1), check if it\\'s valid (i.e., not all closed). For each such schedule:\\n   - For each shop i, compute the count of overlapping periods (the intersection between Joisino\\'s open periods and the shop i\\'s open periods).\\n   - Sum the corresponding P_i,c_i for all shops.\\n   - Keep track of the maximum sum.\\n\\nSo how do we represent the periods? Let\\'s think of each period as a 10-bit binary number. For example, each bit represents a specific period. For example, the first bit (bit 0) could be Monday morning, bit 1 Monday evening, and so on up to Friday evening (bit 9). Then, each shop\\'s F array can be converted into a bitmask, where each bit is 1 if they are open in that period.\\n\\nThen, Joisino\\'s schedule is a bitmask, and for each shop i, the overlapping periods count is the number of set bits in the AND of Joisino\\'s mask and the shop i\\'s mask.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s a good approach.\\n\\nSo the steps for the code:\\n\\n1. Read N.\\n2. Read for each shop i, their 10 F values. For each i, create a bitmask (integer) where each bit is 1 if F_{i,j,k} is 1. So for example, the first value is F_{1,1,1} (Monday morning), which corresponds to the 0th bit (assuming we index from 0 to 9). Let\\'s see: perhaps the order given in the input is F_{i,1,1}, F_{i,1,2}, F_{i,2,1}, F_{i,2,2}, ..., F_{i,5,1}, F_{i,5,2}. So 10 values in order: Day 1 (Monday) Period 1 (morning), Day 1 Period 2 (evening), then Day 2 Period 1, etc. So for each of the 10 positions (indexes 0-9), we can build a bitmask. So for each i, the mask is sum( (F_ijk) << bit_position ), where bit_position is from 0 to 9. For example, for the first F value (Monday morning), it\\'s bit 0, then Monday evening is bit 1, etc.\\n\\nSo for example, if a shop\\'s F values are [1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1], the mask would be 1 for bits 0 (Monday morning), 1 (Monday evening), 3 (Tuesday morning), 7 (Thursday evening), 9 (Friday evening). So the mask would be 1 <<0 + 1<<1 +1<<3 +1<<7 +1<<9 = 1 +2 +8 +128 +512 = 651.\\n\\nSo each shop\\'s mask can be stored as an integer.\\n\\n3. For each shop i, also read the P_i,0 to P_i,10. So for each i, an array of 11 elements. Because c_i can range from 0 to 10, and for each possible c_i, we use P_i,c_i.\\n\\n4. Now, for all possible Joisino\\'s masks (from 1 to 1023, since 0 is invalid). For each mask:\\n\\n   a. Check that it\\'s not zero (since the shop must be open at least once). But since we\\'re iterating from 1 to 1023, this is ensured.\\n\\n   b. For each shop i, compute the overlap: the number of bits set in (mask & shop_i_mask). This is c_i for that shop.\\n\\n   c. Sum P_i[c_i] for all shops i.\\n\\n   d. Keep track of the maximum sum.\\n\\nSo the crux is to compute this sum efficiently. Since N is up to 100 and each mask iteration is 100 * 1000 (1023 masks), that\\'s 100,000 operations, which is manageable.\\n\\nSo the code structure would be:\\n\\n- Read N.\\n- Read N lines of 10 F values, convert each to a mask.\\n- Read N lines of 11 P values, store as a list of lists.\\n- Iterate over all possible masks (1 to 1023 inclusive).\\n- For each mask, compute the sum for all shops.\\n- Find the maximum sum.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about how to convert the F arrays to masks.\\n\\nFor each shop i, the input line has 10 numbers, which are F_{i,1,1}, F_{i,1,2}, F_{i,2,1}, F_{i,2,2}, F_{i,3,1}, F_{i,3,2}, F_{i,4,1}, F_{i,4,2}, F_{i,5,1}, F_{i,5,2}.\\n\\nSo the order is:\\n\\nDay 1 (Monday) periods 1 and 2,\\n\\nDay 2 periods 1 and 2,\\n\\nup to Day 5 periods 1 and 2.\\n\\nSo the 10 elements are ordered as follows:\\n\\npositions 0-9 correspond to:\\n\\n0: Day1 Period1\\n\\n1: Day1 Period2\\n\\n2: Day2 Period1\\n\\n3: Day2 Period2\\n\\n4: Day3 Period1\\n\\n5: Day3 Period2\\n\\n6: Day4 Period1\\n\\n7: Day4 Period2\\n\\n8: Day5 Period1\\n\\n9: Day5 Period2\\n\\nWait, no. The first element is F_{i,1,1} (Day 1, Period 1), which is position 0. Then F_{i,1,2} is position 1. Then F_{i,2,1} (Day 2, Period1) is position 2, etc. Wait, no. Wait, the input for each shop is given as F_{i,1,1} F_{i,1,2} F_{i,2,1} F_{i,2,2} ... F_{i,5,2}. So the order is:\\n\\nFor each day j from 1 to 5, and for each period k=1 and 2. So the order of the 10 elements is:\\n\\nj=1: k=1, k=2\\n\\nj=2: k=1, k=2\\n\\n...\\n\\nj=5: k=1, k=2.\\n\\nSo the indexes for each of the 10 positions are as follows:\\n\\n0: j=1, k=1 → Monday morning.\\n\\n1: j=1, k=2 → Monday evening.\\n\\n2: j=2, k=1 → Tuesday morning.\\n\\n3: j=2, k=2 → Tuesday evening.\\n\\n4: j=3, k=1 → Wednesday morning.\\n\\n5: j=3, k=2 → Wednesday evening.\\n\\n6: j=4, k=1 → Thursday morning.\\n\\n7: j=4, k=2 → Thursday evening.\\n\\n8: j=5, k=1 → Friday morning.\\n\\n9: j=5, k=2 → Friday evening.\\n\\nSo for each of the 10 elements in the input line for a shop, the position in the bitmask is from 0 to 9. So, for example, if the first element is 1, that sets bit 0. The second element (if 1) sets bit 1, etc.\\n\\nSo to create the mask for a shop:\\n\\nmask = 0\\n\\nfor idx in 0 to 9:\\n\\n   if F[idx] == 1:\\n\\n       mask |= (1 << idx)\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo for each shop\\'s F line, we can read the 10 numbers as a list of integers, then compute the mask as the sum of (bit << idx) for idx where F[idx] is 1.\\n\\nOnce all masks are computed, for each possible Joisino\\'s mask (from 1 to 1023), compute for each shop the count of overlapping bits, then sum the corresponding P_i\\'s.\\n\\nNow, the next part is how to compute the count of overlapping bits between Joisino\\'s mask and the shop\\'s mask. The bitwise AND of the two masks gives a mask where the bits are set only where both are open. Then, the number of set bits in this result is the count c_i for that shop. For example, if Joisino\\'s mask is 5 (binary 101) and the shop\\'s mask is 3 (binary 011), then the AND is 001 (binary 1), which has 1 set bit. So c_i is 1.\\n\\nIn Python, the number of set bits can be found using the bin(x).count(\\'1\\') function, or using a built-in function. For speed, perhaps using the built-in popcount, but in Python, bin is straightforward.\\n\\nSo, for each shop i, during processing a Joisino mask:\\n\\nc_i = bin( (joisino_mask & shop_masks[i]) ).bit_count()\\n\\nWait, in Python 3.10+, there\\'s a bit_count() method for integers. Alternatively, bin(...).count(\\'1\\') works.\\n\\nSo, code steps:\\n\\nRead N.\\n\\nFor each of N shops:\\n\\n   read 10 numbers as a list.\\n\\n   compute mask for the shop as the sum of (1 << idx) for each idx where F[idx] is 1.\\n\\nThen read N lines, each with 11 numbers: P_{i,0}, P_{i,1}, ..., P_{i,10}\\n\\nStore as a list of lists, say, profits[i][c] = P_i,c.\\n\\nThen, for each possible joisino_mask in 1 to 1023:\\n\\n   total = 0\\n\\n   for each shop i in 0 to N-1:\\n\\n       overlap = joisino_mask & shop_masks[i]\\n\\n       c = bin(overlap).count(\\'1\\')\\n\\n       total += profits[i][c]\\n\\n   if total is larger than current maximum, update maximum.\\n\\nFinally, output the maximum.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s the plan.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s test this against the sample inputs.\\n\\nFirst sample input:\\n\\n1\\n\\n1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 → the F array for shop 1.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s see:\\n\\nThe list is 10 elements. Let\\'s list their indexes (0-9):\\n\\n0:1 (bit 0 set)\\n\\n1:1 (bit1 set)\\n\\n2:0 (bit2 not set)\\n\\n3:1 (bit3 set)\\n\\n4:0 (bit4 not set)\\n\\n5:0 (bit5 not set)\\n\\n6:0 (bit6 not set)\\n\\n7:1 (bit7 set)\\n\\n8:0 (bit8 not set)\\n\\n9:1 (bit9 set)\\n\\nSo the shop mask is 1<<0 +1<<1 +1<<3 +1<<7 +1<<9 = 1 + 2 + 8 + 128 + 512 = 651.\\n\\nThen, the P line is 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -2 -3 4 -2 → indexes 0-10.\\n\\nNow, Joisino\\'s possible masks. We need to find the mask that gives the maximum sum (since there\\'s only one shop).\\n\\nFor example, in the sample output, the answer is 8.\\n\\nWait, the sample output is 8. Let\\'s see.\\n\\nThe P array for shop 1 is [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,-2,-3,4,-2], which are P_1,0 to P_1,10.\\n\\nSo, for a given c_i (number of overlaps), the profit is P_1,c_i.\\n\\nWe need to choose Joisino\\'s mask such that when overlapped with the shop\\'s mask (bits 0,1,3,7,9), the count of set bits in the AND is c_i, and P_1,c_i is as large as possible.\\n\\nBut since the total profit is the sum of all P_i,c_i (here, only one P_1,c_1), the maximum possible is the maximum possible P_1,c_1.\\n\\nBut we have to make sure that Joisino\\'s mask is not all zeros.\\n\\nWait, but in the sample input, the shop\\'s mask is 651 (binary 1010001011). So any mask that Joisino chooses will have some overlap. But according to the problem statement, Joisino\\'s shop must be open in at least one period.\\n\\nWait, the shop\\'s mask is 1010001011, which is 5 set bits. So Joisino\\'s mask can be any non-zero 10-bit mask, and the overlapping count is the number of set bits in the AND.\\n\\nSo for example, if Joisino\\'s mask is the same as the shop\\'s mask, then the overlapping count is 5. Then P_1,5 would be 8 (since the P array is 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,-2,-3,4,-2. The index 5 is 8).\\n\\nBut perhaps there\\'s a better value. Let\\'s see.\\n\\nLooking at the P array: for c_i from 0 to 10.\\n\\nc_i=0: P is 3. But Joisino\\'s mask can\\'t be zero, so this is not possible.\\n\\nc_i=1: P is 4.\\n\\nc_i=2:5.\\n\\nc_i=3:6.\\n\\nc_i=4:7.\\n\\nc_i=5:8.\\n\\nc_i=6:9.\\n\\nc_i=7:-2.\\n\\nc_i=8:-3.\\n\\nc_i=9:4.\\n\\nc_i=10:-2.\\n\\nSo the maximum P_i,c_i is 9 when c_i=6. But how can Joisino\\'s mask have an overlap of 6 with the shop\\'s mask?\\n\\nThat would require that the AND of the shop\\'s mask (which has 5 set bits) and Joisino\\'s mask has 6 set bits. But since the shop\\'s mask has only 5 bits set, the AND can\\'t have more than 5 bits. So that\\'s impossible. So the maximum possible c_i is 5, leading to P=8. Hence the sample output is 8.\\n\\nSo the code would correctly compute that.\\n\\nBut wait, the sample output is 8, which is when c_i is 5. So in that case, Joisino\\'s mask must have 5 bits overlapping with the shop\\'s mask. Which would happen when she chooses exactly the same mask as the shop. Then the overlapping count is 5. So the profit is 8.\\n\\nBut wait, what if Joisino\\'s mask has more bits set than the shop\\'s? Like, she\\'s open in all 10 periods. Then the AND would be the shop\\'s mask (5 bits), so c_i=5 again. So the P would still be 8. But maybe another mask gives a higher profit.\\n\\nWait, but according to the P array, the highest possible is 9 for c_i=6, which is impossible. So the next best is 8.\\n\\nSo the code would correctly find that the maximum is 8.\\n\\nSo the sample input 1 is handled correctly.\\n\\nNow, the second sample input.\\n\\nInput:\\n\\n2\\n\\nShop 1\\'s F is 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 → which corresponds to days 1-5, morning periods (since for day j, period 1). Wait, let\\'s list the indexes 0-9:\\n\\nDay 1, period 1 → index 0 → 1.\\n\\nDay 1, period 2 → index1 →1.\\n\\nDay 2, period1 → index2 →1.\\n\\nDay2, period2 → index3 →1.\\n\\nDay3, period1 → index4 →1.\\n\\nDay3, period2 → index5 →0.\\n\\nDay4, period1 → index6 →0.\\n\\nDay4, period2 → index7 →0.\\n\\nDay5, period1 → index8 →0.\\n\\nDay5, period2 → index9 →0.\\n\\nSo the mask is 1<<0 | 1<<1 | 1<<2 | 1<<3 | 1<<4 → sum is 1+2+4+8+16=31 (binary 11111, bits 0-4 set).\\n\\nShop 2\\'s F is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 → indexes 5-9 are set. So mask is (1<<5) + (1<<6) + (1<<7) + (1<<8) + (1<<9) → 32 +64 +128 +256 +512 = 992 (binary 1111100000).\\n\\nThe P lines are for both shops:\\n\\nFirst shop\\'s P line is 0 -2 -2 ... -1. So for shop 1, P_1,0 is 0 (but Joisino\\'s mask can\\'t be zero), P_1,1 is -2, and so on. Similarly for shop 2.\\n\\nWe need to choose a Joisino mask that when ANDed with shop1\\'s mask and shop2\\'s mask gives c1 and c2 such that the sum of P1[c1] and P2[c2] is maximum.\\n\\nThe sample output is -2.\\n\\nLet\\'s see. The possible options for Joisino\\'s mask. Since shop1\\'s mask is 31 (bits 0-4), shop2\\'s mask is 992 (bits5-9). Any Joisino\\'s mask that has bits only in 0-4 will overlap with shop1, but not shop2, and vice versa.\\n\\nSuppose Joisino\\'s mask is 1 (bit0 set). Then:\\n\\nc1 = number of overlapping bits with shop1\\'s mask (bit0 is set in both) → 1. P1[1] is -2.\\n\\nc2 = overlap with shop2\\'s mask (0) → 0. But shop2\\'s P[0] is 0. So total is -2 +0 =-2.\\n\\nAlternatively, if Joisino\\'s mask is 32 (bit5 set):\\n\\nc1=0 (overlap with shop1\\'s mask is 0) → P1[0] is 0 (but shop1\\'s mask requires that the shop is open in at least one period? Wait, no: the problem says that each existing shop must be open in at least one period, but Joisino\\'s mask is the one that needs to be open in at least one. So in this case, Joisino\\'s mask is 32 (bit5 set), which is open in period5. Then for shop1, the overlap is zero (since shop1\\'s mask is 0-4 bits). So c1=0. For shop2, the overlap is 1 (bit5 is set in both). So P1[0] is 0 (from the input, the first shop\\'s P line is 0 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1). So P1[0] is 0. Then P2[1] is the second shop\\'s P line, which is 0 -2 ... etc. Wait, the P lines for shop2 are the same as shop1\\'s? Let\\'s check the input.\\n\\nThe second input\\'s shops:\\n\\nFirst shop\\'s F line is the first line (1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0), second\\'s is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1.\\n\\nThen the P lines are:\\n\\nFor shop1: 0 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 → which is P1,0=0, P1,1=-2, etc.\\n\\nShop2\\'s P line is the same: 0 -2 ... So for shop2, c2=1 would give P2,1=-2.\\n\\nSo if Joisino\\'s mask is 32 (bit5), then:\\n\\nc1=0 → P1[0] is 0 (but according to the problem statement, each existing shop must have at least one open period, but that\\'s already handled. For Joisino\\'s shop, it\\'s allowed to have a mask that\\'s non-zero, but when ANDed with a shop\\'s mask, the c_i can be zero. So shop1\\'s c_i can be zero here.\\n\\nSo for this case, sum is 0 (from shop1) + P2[1] which is -2. So total is 0-2=-2.\\n\\nBut in the sample output, it\\'s -2. So maybe that\\'s the maximum.\\n\\nOther possibilities: suppose Joisino\\'s mask is 0 in all bits. But that\\'s invalid, so not considered.\\n\\nWhat if Joisino\\'s mask is 1 (bit0) and 32 (bit5)? Then the mask is 33. Then for shop1, overlap is 1 (bit0) → P1[1]=-2. For shop2, overlap is 1 (bit5) → P2[1]=-2. Total is -4. Which is worse than -2.\\n\\nAlternatively, if Joisino\\'s mask is 31 (bits 0-4 all set). Then c1=5 (overlap is 5, since shop1\\'s mask is 31). So P1[5] is -2. For shop2, overlap is 0 → P2[0] is 0. So total is -2 +0 =-2.\\n\\nSimilarly, if Joisino\\'s mask is 992 (shop2\\'s mask), then c2=5, which for shop2\\'s P is P2[5] = -2. c1=0 → P1[0] =0. So total is 0 + (-2) =-2.\\n\\nSo the maximum possible is -2. Hence the sample output.\\n\\nThus, the code would correctly compute this.\\n\\nThird sample input is more complex, but with the same approach.\\n\\nSo, the code seems correct.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s code this.\\n\\nIn Python:\\n\\nRead N.\\n\\nRead N lines of 10 integers each. For each line, compute the mask by checking each bit. For example:\\n\\nshop_masks = []\\nfor _ in range(N):\\n    f = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    mask = 0\\n    for idx in range(10):\\n        if f[idx] == 1:\\n            mask |= (1 << idx)\\n    shop_masks.append(mask)\\n\\nThen read N lines of 11 integers each. So:\\n\\nprofits = []\\nfor _ in range(N):\\n    p = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    profits.append(p)\\n\\nThen, iterate through all possible Joisino masks from 1 to 1023:\\n\\nmax_total = -float(\\'inf\\')\\n\\nfor joisino_mask in range(1, 1<<10):\\n    total = 0\\n    for i in range(N):\\n        overlap = joisino_mask & shop_masks[i]\\n        c = bin(overlap).count(\\'1\\')\\n        total += profits[i][c]\\n    if total > max_total:\\n        max_total = total\\n\\nprint(max_total)\\n\\nWait, but in Python, 1<<10 is 1024. So the range should be from 1 to 1023 inclusive.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the code is straightforward.\\n\\nTesting this code with the samples should work.\\n\\nThe first sample:\\n\\nN=1.\\n\\nshop_masks[0] is 651.\\n\\nprofits[0] is [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,-2,-3,4,-2]\\n\\nFor each possible mask, compute c= bin( (mask & 651) ).count(\\'1\\').\\n\\nThe maximum P[0][c] is 8, which occurs when c=5.\\n\\nThus, the code would output 8.\\n\\nSecond sample: output is -2.\\n\\nThird sample: output is 23.\\n\\nThus, the code is correct.\\n\\n<|end_of_thought|>\\n\\n<|begin_of_solution|>\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal schedule for Joisino\\'s shop such that her profit is maximized. The profit is calculated based on overlapping open periods with existing shops, and each shop\\'s contribution to the profit depends on the number of overlapping periods.\\n\\n### Approach\\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each shop\\'s schedule is given for 10 periods (5 days with morning and evening each). Joisino\\'s shop can be open or closed in each of these periods, and the profit is determined by the sum of contributions from each existing shop based on the number of overlapping open periods.\\n2. **Bitmask Representation**: Each shop\\'s schedule can be represented as a 10-bit bitmask where each bit indicates if the shop is open during a specific period. Similarly, Joisino\\'s schedule can be represented as a bitmask.\\n3. **Brute Force Search**: Given the manageable number of possible schedules (1023 valid combinations), we can use a brute force approach to check all possible valid schedules for Joisino\\'s shop. For each schedule, compute the profit and track the maximum profit.\\n\\n### Solution Code\\n```python\\ndef main():\\n    import sys\\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\\n    ptr = 0\\n    N = int(input[ptr])\\n    ptr += 1\\n    \\n    shop_masks = []\\n    for _ in range(N):\\n        f = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+10]))\\n        ptr += 10\\n        mask = 0\\n        for idx in range(10):\\n            if f[idx] == 1:\\n                mask |= 1 << idx\\n        shop_masks.append(mask)\\n    \\n    profits = []\\n    for _ in range(N):\\n        p = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+11]))\\n        ptr += 11\\n        profits.append(p)\\n    \\n    max_total = -float(\\'inf\\')\\n    for joisino_mask in range(1, 1 << 10):\\n        total = 0\\n        for i in range(N):\\n            overlap = joisino_mask & shop_masks[i]\\n            c = bin(overlap).count(\\'1\\')\\n            total += profits[i][c]\\n        if total > max_total:\\n            max_total = total\\n    print(max_total)\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    main()\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of shops, their respective schedules, and profit values.\\n2. **Bitmask Conversion**: Each shop\\'s schedule is converted into a bitmask where each bit represents whether the shop is open during a specific period.\\n3. **Profit Calculation**: For each possible valid schedule (bitmask) of Joisino\\'s shop, the profit is calculated by determining the number of overlapping periods with each existing shop and summing the corresponding profit values.\\n4. **Max Profit Tracking**: The maximum profit across all valid schedules is tracked and printed.\\n\\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible schedules using bitmask operations, ensuring that we find the optimal solution within the problem constraints.\\n\\n<|end_of_solution|>'}]}"
